## Description
In the Devlop folder is the code for a Node.js application using Sequelize and Passport. I have included a documentation that outlines each file's purpose, required resources and dependency upon other files. The intention of this documentation is to ensure that when someone reads it, they understand the codebase. I have also included some recommendations for how this application could be improved.

## User Story
```
AS A developer

I WANT a walk-through of the codebase

SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project
```

## Business Context
When joining a new team, developers will be expected to inspect a lot of code that they have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line for the new team member, developers need to be able to dissect the code by themselves, saving any questions for a member of the team.

## Documentation
